	<h1>Why I am want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>
        Ever since I was young, I have been fascinated by technology and how it shapes the world around us. The ability to create software that solves problems, automates tasks, and brings people together excites me. As a software developer, I am motivated by the opportunity to continuously learn, tackle new challenges, and make an impact in various fieldsâ€”from improving healthcare to advancing education. Being a developer means having the power to bring ideas to life and create solutions that can help individuals and businesses achieve their goals.
